# OneFeed

## Target Group: anyone who consumes content on the internet

Neuropsychologists such as Lutz JÃ¤ncke report that the user's brain is overwhelmed by the flood of information on the Internet and thus loses the ability to distinguish between qualitative and quantitative content. Therefore, One Feed should make it possible to consume all media consumption on the Internet through one channel and thus also to control it in order to prevent the brain from being overwhelmed.

### Notification Service

- To remember the User about possible new News, we have implementet an Notification Service
- If the app is active, a time slot in which a message is to be sent is communicated to a broadcast
   receiver via a service.
- The slots are defined in the app so that the user can only be reminded at certain times.
- Once a notification has been sent, none is sent until the user opens the app again,
   so as not to disturb the user with many messages.
   
### Additional Features

- in order to be able to use the app with large displays, we use multi-gestures to facilitate navigation.(ABB.5)

## Erreichter Stand

The app allows you to pre-select news portals on your own. You have the option of specifying your interests and your consumption is tracked and blocked if you have set your daily Limit in the app.

- The app does not offer the option of adding an RSS feed independently, as these xml files are always structured differently.
- The app does not include its own reader, as we are unable to download the texts from news portals for legal reasons. 

## Further Hints
- To test the app, you will need a Twitter account to log in with during the onboarding process. 
- To install the app, you need a mobile phone with at least Android Q. The app is designed for smartphones.
- The app has been programmed for use on a smartphone
